# esp32_tools

Some scripts to aid in ESP32 development. 

The ocd_* scripts are all symlinks to ocd_flash to ease development. These simplify working with the ESP32 JTAG board.

The ota script calls my modified version of the update_firmware.py script to, you guessed it, perform OTA updates.

Provided "as is". Who knows, someone may also find them useful :)
